### Description

Need a drop in place control to provide flicker free form subclassing that can monitor form size, form move, theme changes, system color changes, and display resolution changes, then give this control a try. Simply drop this control on your form, set the properties and that is it&#8230;no extra modules, no external dependencies, just this little control! This control not only does this, but prevents additional instances of itself to prevent nasty GPF&#8217;s. Huge thanks to Paul Caton for his self-subclassing templates and examples. This project simply pulls these ideas together in a neat little package, and I simply added a few additional events that might be handy for the developer&#8230;.enjoy!
